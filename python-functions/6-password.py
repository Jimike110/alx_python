# Write a Python function called validate_password that takes a password as input and performs the following checks:

# The password should be at least 8 characters long.
# The password should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
# The password should not contain spaces.

# Prototype: def validate_password(password)

# Returns True if the password passes all the checks, and False otherwise.

# You are not allowed to import any module.
